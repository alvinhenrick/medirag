pink film coating contains hypromellose 2910 polyethylene glycol 400 titanium dioxide and iron oxide red\n\n12 clinical pharmacology:\n - clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the p2y12class of adp receptors on platelets\n - clopidogrel must be metabolized by cyp450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation the active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate adp to its platelet p2y12receptor and the subsequent adpmediated activation of the glycoprotein gpiibiiia complex thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation this action is irreversible consequently platelets exposed to clopidogrels active metabolite are affected for the remainder of their lifespan about 7 to 10 days platelet aggregation induced by agonists other than adp is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of platelet activation by released adp\n - dosedependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses of clopidogrel repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day inhibit adpinduced platelet aggregation on the first day and inhibition reaches steady state between day 3 and day 7 at steady state the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg clopidogrel per day was between 40 and 60 platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually return to baseline values after treatment is discontinued generally in about 5 days\n - \n - geriatric patients\n - elderly 75 years and young healthy subjects had similar effects on platelet aggregation\n - renally impaired patients\n - after repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day patients with severe renal impairment creatinine clearance from 5 to 15 mlmin and moderate renal impairment creatinine clearance from 30 to 60 mlmin showed low 25 inhibition of adpinduced platelet aggregation\n - hepatically impaired patients\n - after repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic impairment inhibition of adpinduced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy subjects\n - gender\n - in a small study comparing men and women less inhibition of adpinduced platelet aggregation", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 50805, "end_char_idx": 55497,

lipid regulating agent which decreases serum triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein vldl cholesterol and increases high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol while modest decreases in total and low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol may be observed with gemfibrozil therapy treatment of patients with elevated triglycerides due to type iv hyperlipoproteinemia often results in a rise in ldlcholesterol ldlcholesterol levels in type iib patients with elevations of both serum ldlcholesterol and triglycerides are in general minimally affected by gemfibrozil treatment however gemfibrozil usually raises hdlcholesterol significantly in this group gemfibrozil increases levels of high density lipoprotein hdl subfractions hdl2and hdl3 as well as apolipoproteins ai and aii epidemiological studies have shown that both low hdlcholesterol and high ldlcholesterol are independent risk factors for coronary heart disease\n - in the primary prevention component of the helsinki heart study in which 4081 male patients between the ages of 40 and 55 were studied in a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled fashion gemfibrozil therapy was associated with significant reductions in total plasma

acids thus reducing hepatic triglyceride production gemfibrozil inhibits synthesis and increases clearance of vldl carrier apolipoprotein b leading to a decrease in vldl production\n - animal studies suggest that gemfibrozil may in addition to elevating hdlcholesterol reduce incorporation of longchain fatty acids into newly formed triglycerides accelerate turnover and removal of cholesterol from the liver and increase excretion of cholesterol in the feces gemfibrozil is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration peak plasma levels occur in 1 to 2 hours with a plasma halflife of 15 hours following multiple doses\n - gemfibrozil is completely absorbed after oral administration of gemfibrozil tablets reaching peak plasma concentrations 1 to 2 hours after

total mortality in the clofibratetreated group than in a comparable placebotreated control group during the trial period the excess mortality was due to a 33 increase in noncardiovascular causes including malignancy postcholecystectomy complications and pancreatitis the higher risk of clofibratetreated subjects for gallbladder disease was confirmed\n - because of the more limited size of the

interval ci 132 to 150 there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure less than 5 years median of 3 years vs greater than 5 years median of 10 years of use before the cancer

566 or 755 cm2and contains 0314 0470 0627 0940 or 1253 mg of estradiol usp respectively the composition of the systems per unit area is identical\n - estradiol usp is a white to practically white powder chemically described as estra135 10 triene317diol\n - the structural formula is\n - the molecular formula of estradiol usp is c18h2402 the molecular weight is 27239 gmol\n - dotti is comprised of 3 layers proceeding from the visible surface toward the surface attached to the skin these layers are 1 polyester and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer film 2 an adhesive formulation containing estradiol usp acrylic adhesive silicone adhesive oleyl alcohol nf povidone usp and dipropylene glycol and 3 a polyester release liner which is attached to the adhesive surface and must be removed before the system can be used\n - the active component of the system is estradiol usp the remaining components of the system are pharmacologically inactive\n - fda approved acceptance criteria for dissolution test specifications differ from usp\n\n12 clinical pharmacology:\n - endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites estrone and estriol at the receptor level\n - the primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle after menopause most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione secreted by the adrenal cortex to estrone in the peripheral tissues thus estrone and the sulfate conjugated form estrone sulfate are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women\n - estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogenresponsive tissues to date 2 estrogen receptors have been identified these vary in proportion from tissue to tissue\n - circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone lh and follicle stimulating hormone fsh through a negative feedback mechanism estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women\n - generally a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual womans therapeutic response to dotti nor her risk for adverse outcomes likewise exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid\n - absorption\n - in a multipledose study consisting of 3 consecutive system applications of the original formulation of estradiol transdermal system which was conducted in 17 healthy postmenopausal women blood levels of estradiol and estrone were compared following application of these units to sites on the abdomen and buttocks in a crossover fashion systems that deliver nominal estradiol doses of approximately 00375 mg per day and 01 mg per day were applied to abdominal application sites while the 01 mg per day doses were also applied to sites on the buttocks these systems increased estradiol levels above baseline within 4 hours and maintained respective mean levels of 25 and 79 pgml above baseline following application to the abdomen slightly higher mean levels of 88 pgml above baseline were observed following application to the buttocks at the same time increases in estrone plasma concentrations averaged about 12 and 50 pgml respectively following application to the abdomen and 61 pgml for the buttocks while plasma concentrations of estradiol and estrone remained slightly above

dissolution test specifications differ from usp\n\n12 clinical pharmacology:\n - endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites estrone and estriol at the receptor level\n - the primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle after menopause most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione secreted by the adrenal cortex to estrone in the peripheral tissues thus estrone and the sulfate conjugated form estrone sulfate are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women\n - estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogenresponsive tissues to date 2 estrogen receptors have been identified these vary in proportion from tissue to tissue\n - circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone lh and follicle stimulating hormone fsh through a negative feedback mechanism estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women\n - generally a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual womans therapeutic response to dotti nor her risk for adverse outcomes likewise exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid\n - absorption\n - in a multipledose study consisting of 3 consecutive system applications of the original

following application of these units to sites on the abdomen and buttocks in a crossover fashion systems that deliver nominal estradiol doses of approximately 00375 mg per day and 01 mg per day were applied to abdominal application sites while the 01 mg per day doses were also applied to sites on the buttocks these systems increased estradiol levels above baseline within 4 hours and maintained respective mean levels of 25 and 79 pgml above baseline following application to the abdomen slightly higher mean levels of 88 pgml above baseline were observed following application to the buttocks

concentrations in the sex hormone target organs estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormonebinding globulin shbg and albumin\n - metabolism\n - exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions these transformations take place mainly in the liver by cytochrome 450 isoforms cyp1a2 and cyp3a4 estradiol undergoes further metabolism to sulfate and glucuronide conjugates estradiol and its metabolites are glucuronidated by ugt1a1 and ugt2b7 estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone and both can be converted to estriol which is a major urinary metabolite estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption in postmenopausal women a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates especially estrone sulfate which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens\n - excretion\n - estradiol estrone and estriol are excreted in the urine along
